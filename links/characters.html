							<p>Killua has spiky silver hair, very pale skin, and blue eyes. His eyes change shape depending on the mood that he's in, narrowing and sharpening when he goes into assassination mode.

							<h2>Hisoka Morow</h2>
							<p>Hisoka Morow („Éí„ÇΩ„Ç´„Ç†„É¢„É≠„Ç¶, Hisoka Morou) is a Hunter and former member #4 of the Phantom Troupe; his physical strength ranked third in the group. He is always in search for strong opponents, and would spare those who have great potential, such as Gon and Killua in order for them to get strong enough to actually challenge him.</p>
							<p>He originally served as the primary antagonist of the Hunter Exam arc and a secondary one of the Heavens Arena arc, before becoming a supporting character during the Yorknew City arc and Greed Island arc. During the 13th Hunter Chairman Election arc, he briefly reprises his role as a secondary antagonist.</p>
						</div>
						<div id="cast_img"><img src="../img/characters/hisoka.png"></div>
					</div>
					<div style="margin-top:-2.5%">
						<p>Hisoka's appearance is similar to that of a magician or jester. He is tall and has light skin and a very muscular physique. His attire is usually adorned with various suit symbols (‚ô¶/‚ô¶ ‚ô£/‚ô£ ‚ô•/‚ô• ‚ô†/‚ô†) on the front and back torso, and he changes outfits in each story arc. He wears face paint of a star (‚òÖ) on his right cheek and a teardrop (üíß) on his left cheek, and like his attire, in the 2011 anime, his face paint also occasionally changes colors. During the Greed Island arc, Hisoka wears the Greed Island Ring on his left middle finger. And in the 13th Hunter Chairman Election arc, Hisoka wears a pair of earrings with ornamental hearts. For unknown reasons, Hisoka has long, pointed nails, giving his hands a claw-like appearance, hinting at his sinister nature.</p>
						<p>In his first appearance in the 1999 anime series, Hisoka's hair is blue. After a revamp of the show, it was replaced with a red or almost neon pink color to be in accordance with the manga. In the 2011 anime, Hisoka has red hair and light amber eyes. In the manga, during the Yorknew City arc, Hisoka dyes his hair light green. These dynamic variations in appearance illustrate the complexity of his character.</p>

							<p>Bisky likes to act and look like a young girl. Her overall aspect is reminiscent of a porcelain doll. She is often shown wearing a sleeveless dress and a bloomer with a mantelet and skirt donned over it, along with gloves and plain leather shoes. She always has her hair tied up neatly and has changed its style 3 times throughout the storyline.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div style="margin-top:-2.5%">
						<p>In her true form, she is a massive and extremely muscular woman several times the size of her preferred form. Although she claims to stay in her younger form to have the enemy underestimate her, the main reason is that she hates her original appearance. Regardless of which form she is in, Bisky is very powerful. However, she does receive a tremendous power boost in terms of physical strength when she reverts (her Nen stays relatively unchanged in-between her forms). As a Royal Bodyguard, she wears her hair in a laced bun and dresses in a suit and tie.</p><p>She has brown hair and blue eyes. In the 1999 anime, her hair is a lighter brown than in the manga. In the 2011 anime, her hair is blonde and her eyes are pink.</p>

Netero was commonly seen wearing a traditional man's kimono and pair of geta with one ha (tooth).</p>
						</div>

						<p>During the Chimera Ant arc, he changed his appearance for his upcoming fight with Meruem by trimming his beard, mustache, and ponytail. When in combat, Netero preferred to wear a t-shirt with the Japanese kanji character for the word "heart/mind", „ÄåÂøÉ„Äç(kokoro), printed on the front and track shorts.
						<p>Some of his physical characteristics are similar to those of buddhas and their buddharupas in Buddhist art, like large protruding ears, exaggerated eyebrows that curve upward, half-closed eyes, thin lips and hair bun that points to the top, and even the mustache.</p>
						<p>During his expedition in Dark Continent in his youth, he was shown to have long spiky hair.</p>

Ging dons a normal, dark blue/grey scarf wrapped around his neck and long, skinny black crew boots.</p>
